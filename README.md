# Numerical Optimization

This repo started off as a self study and visualization of various numerical optimization algorithms but eventually branched out
to many algorithm visualization that are not necessarily connected with eachother.

- `Stork` is my implementation of pytorch's sequential compuational graph approach to neural networks.
More information can be found [here](num_opt/stork/README.md).
- `Autograd` is my implementation of using dual numbers to calculate gradients. Forward and reverse mode autodifferentiation is implemented.
- `Algorithm` contains various other numerical algorithm implementations. Most code based from text `Algorithms For Optimization` by Kochenderfer et al.
